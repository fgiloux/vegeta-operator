This repository contains the code for creating an operator managing runs of the https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta[Vegeta HTTP load testing tool] on Kubernetes / OpenShift.

It has 3 components

* **https://github.com/fgiloux/vegeta-operator/tree/main/images[A container image]** Inspired by https://github.com/peter-evans/vegeta-docker[Vegeta docker] containing the Vegeta program.
* **https://github.com/fgiloux/vegeta-operator/tree/main/vegeta-operator[The Vegeta Operator]** that makes possibe to launch attacks by creating Vegeta https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[custom resources].
* **https://github.com/fgiloux/vegeta-operator/tree/main/s3[A small S3 app]** that allows to download from and to upload to an S3 bucket results and reports. It is packed into the Vegeta container image.

It leverages the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang[operator-sdk].

For installation details and quickstart look at the https://github.com/fgiloux/vegeta-operator/tree/main/vegeta-operator[Operator's README]
