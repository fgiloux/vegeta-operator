*WORK IN PROGRESS*

This repository contains the code for creating a container image for the https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta[Vegeta HTTP load testing tool]. Inspired by https://github.com/peter-evans/vegeta-docker[Vegeta docker].
It also contains the code for managing vegeta resources through an operator.

It leverages the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang[operator-sdk].

This project has a learning component and at this stage I think that creating a https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tasks.md[Tekton task] may be a better approach. The reasoning is that

- there should not be any state to manage that would require an operator
- Tekton Task is a lighter structure. It does not require a new controller and a new CRD, which come at a cost for the cluster it runs on
