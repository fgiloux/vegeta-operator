== Overview

This repository contains the code for creating an operator managing runs of the https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta[Vegeta HTTP load testing tool] on Kubernetes / OpenShift. Inspired by https://github.com/peter-evans/vegeta-docker[Vegeta docker] attacks can be triggered by creating Vegeta https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[custom resources].

It leverages the https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang[operator-sdk].


== Installation

== Build from source

To build the Vegeta Operator from source you will need

- to have go 1.15 or newer installed
- to have a container engine, for instance: docker or podman
- to clone this repository
- to call the few command lines below.

[source,shell]
----
export USERNAME=<quay-username>

export CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman <1>

make docker-build IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator:v0.0.1

podman login quay.io/$USERNAME
make docker-push IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator:v0.0.1 <2>
----
<1> If you are like me using podman rather than docker
<2> Push the image into a repository

NOTE: You may also want to build the container image used for running Vegeta. See its https://github.com/fgiloux/vegeta-operator/tree/main/images[readme page].
