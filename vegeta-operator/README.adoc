== Overview

This repository contains the code for creating an operator managing runs of the https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta[Vegeta HTTP load testing tool] on Kubernetes / OpenShift by creating Vegeta custom resources.

Once installed the operator provides the following features:

- **Launch**: Simply launch a Vegeta test run (attack) on your Kubernetes cluster.

- **Configuration**: Simply configure the parameters of the Vegeta attacks through custom resources.

- **Scalability**: Specify in the custom resources how many pods need to be created for a distributed attack and the resources that should get allocated to each of them.

- **Reports**: Reports are automatically generated and can get either written into logs or stored in a persistent volume or object bucket. Volumes or object buckets are required for consolidated reports in case of a distributed attack.

== Quickstart

=== Prerequisites

The operator has been tested with OpenShift 4.6 / Kubernetes 1.19 and OpenShift 4.7 / Kubernetes 1.20.

=== Installation

For quick installation leveraging OLM (see below) a catalog source pointing to the image index referencing the Vegeta operator image bundle needs to be created.

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: vegeta-manifests
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: Community Vegeta Operator
  publisher: Frederic Giloux
  sourceType: grpc
  image: quay.io/fgiloux/vegeta-operator-index:1.0.0
EOF
----

If you wish so you may create a new namespace and an operator group for insatlling the operator into it:
[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: vegeta-group
  namespace: vegeta-operator
EOF
----

Creating a subscription will then install the operator. This may also be done through the UI:
[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: vegeta-subscription
  namespace: vegeta-operator
spec:
  channel: alpha
  name: vegeta-operator
  source: vegeta-manifests
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
----

=== Run

Once the operator has been installed. Launching a load test is as simple as creating a Vegeta custom resource.

A description of the configuration parameters is available in the CRD. It reflects what is available in https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta[Vegeta] with a few things that are specific to running it on Kubernetes.

Examples of custom resources to configure an attack with pods mounting a config map containing the root certificate of the target or the endpoint details, storing the results in a volume or an object bucket are available in https://github.com/fgiloux/vegeta-operator/tree/main/vegeta-operator/config/samples[./config/samples].

== Build operator from source

To build the Vegeta Operator from source you will need

- to have go 1.15 or newer installed
- to have a container engine, for instance: docker or podman
- to clone this repository
- to call the few command lines below.

[source,shell]
----
export USERNAME=<quay-username>

export CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman <1>

make docker-build IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator:v0.0.1

podman login quay.io/$USERNAME
make docker-push IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator:v0.0.1 <2>
----
<1> If you are like me using podman rather than docker
<2> Push the image into a repository

NOTE: You may also want to build the container image used for running Vegeta. See its https://github.com/fgiloux/vegeta-operator/tree/main/images[readme page]. The default Vegeta image in use is configurable through environment variable at the operator level or in a field of the Vegeta resource for each attack.

== Tests

https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/[Ginkgo], https://onsi.github.io/gomega/[Gomega] and https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/envtest[envtest] are leveraged for automated testing. You may need to https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/references/envtest-setup/
[set up your environment for envtest]

The automated test suite can then simply be run with:

[source,shell]
----
make test
----

To test locally you would need to be connected to a Kubernetes cluster and have deployed the CRD (see below):

You can then start your controller locally:

[source,shell]
----
make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false
----

== Deployment

To deploy your code during development you just need the following steps once you are connected to a Kubernetes cluster:

Register CRDs
[source,shell]
----
make install
----

Deploy
[source,shell]
----
export USERNAME=<quay-username>
make deploy IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator:v0.0.1
----

== Build an image bundle for OLM installation

https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)] extends Kubernetes to provide a declarative way to install, manage, and upgrade Operators and their dependencies in a cluster.

https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/#3-deploy-your-operator-with-olm[To leverage OLM] an image bundle needs to be created and added to an index image.

[source,shell]
----
export USERNAME=<quay-username>
make bundle IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator:v0.0.1
# Creating and pushing the image bundle containing the manifests
make bundle-build BUNDLE_IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
make docker-push IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
# Creating and pushing the index referencing the image bundle
opm index add --bundles quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator-bundle:v0.0.1 --tag quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator-index:1.0.0
podman push quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator-index:1.0.0
----

Once the image bundle and index image are available then can be leveraged for installation.

Therefore a catalog source needs to be created. You may want to amend the namespace it gets installed into and the image containing the index to match your parameters:
[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: vegeta-manifests
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: Community Vegeta Operator
  publisher: Frederic Giloux
  sourceType: grpc
  image: quay.io/fgiloux/vegeta-operator-index:1.0.0
EOF
----

If you wish so you may create a new namespace and an operator group for insatlling the operator into it:

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: vegeta-group
  namespace: vegeta-operator
EOF
----

Creating a subscription will then install the operator. This may also be done through the UI:

[source,shell]
----
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: vegeta-subscription
  namespace: vegeta-operator
spec:
  channel: alpha
  name: vegeta-operator
  source: vegeta-manifests
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
----

== Installation from source

For installing the Operator from source you currently need

* to clone this repository
* to log into the targetted cluster
* to register custom resource definitions:

[source,shell]
----
make install
----

* to deploy the operator

[source,shell]
----
export USERNAME=<quay-username>
make deploy IMG=quay.io/$USERNAME/vegeta-operator:v0.0.1
----
